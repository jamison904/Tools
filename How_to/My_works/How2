[quote][b][color=red]Setting up Linux and a developers environment how to for Linux: [/color][/b][/quote]


Ok guys here is my setup that has successfully worked for me for over 2 years. You have to have a developer environment like this to move on to the "how to" build a basic ROM. Also again this guide is for Linux ( 64 bit is a must!!!) Here goes.

[quote] First you need to figure out if you are going to use a virtual box [url]https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[/url] or dual boot [url]http://goo.gl/zK65u[/url] (which I storngly suggest.) [/quote]

[quote] Now you need to chose the distro [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution[/url][/quote]

[quote] Personally I run Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and strongly suggest you use it as well if you plan on doing extensive development. Head over to Ubuntu and download it there. [URL="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop"]Download page[/URL] [/quote]

[quote] Now after you have downloaded Ubuntu (64 bit!) you need to install Linux.[/quote]

[quote] Easiest way is to put in a blank DVD and click on the ISO(Ubuntu os) and burn the image on the DVD. You can also setup and burn it onto a thumb drive that is at least 4 gb. You will need to Google this if you want to go that way.[/quote]

[quote] once you have burnt the image you will need to install, reboot your computer and watch the screen (make sure the DVD or thumb drive is in.) Most computers will say either hit "ESC" or F9 or F12 to pull up boot options.[/quote]

[quote] Now select the option that say something about DVD/something,,,, this will bring up the options from within the boot disk. Select live boot. This will bring up Linux. Once it is up sign into your Wifi router because this is needed in the install.[/quote]

[quote] Click on the Icon that says install Ubuntu. Install . . . and follow prompts. Very easy setup...[/quote]

[quote] Congratulations you now have Linux installed.  :cool: [/quote][/quote]

[quote] Before anything you need to install right click terminal then reboot for it to effect. Do this now.

[code]
sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal
[/code][/quote]

[quote] Now head over to my github and download the developer setup package I have made for you guys. This way everything is in one place. I will try and keep the tools up to date as well. Download - [url]https://github.com/jamison904/developer_setup[/url]

[/quote]


[quote]Once downloaded, extract. Then open the folder find andadb.sh. Right click it and go to permissions and mark this file executable. Now open termial and;
[code]
. andadb.sh
[/code]
 [/quote]


[quote] Now you will have a few options. BE CAREFUL  :evil:  not to do them all. Some we still will need to do manually and will cause issues if you do them  :shock: here.[/quote]

[b]Update for java[/b]

The script above will install an outdated version of java. No worries, here is the fix.

- first you need to uninstall the current version of Java by copying and pasting this into the terminal:

[code]

sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\* icedtea-\* icedtea6-\*

[/code]

- Say yes and let it do it's thing.

- Now you will install the most supported version of java. [URL="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk6downloads-1902814.html"]Download link[/URL]

[code]
sudo mkdir -p /opt/java/64/
sudo cp jdk-6u38-linux-x64.bin /opt/java/64
sudo su -
cd /opt/java/64
chmod +x jdk-6u38-linux-x64.bin
./jdk-6u38-linux-x64.bin
exit

[/code]

Add your Path for Android SDK  and Java

In terminal do:
[Code]
gedit ~/.bashrc
[/code]

Now add the following to the end of the bashrc:

[CODE]# Java PATHs
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/64/jdk1.6.0_##
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin[/CODE]


[CODE]
#Android PATH
export PATH=$PATH:~/android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:~/android/sdk/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:~/android/sdk/tools[/CODE] 

Then save and close.

Congrats you're done. [/quote]

if you have any issues you may do this manually:

[code]
sudo apt-get install git gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential \
  zip curl libc6-dev libncurses5-dev:i386 x11proto-core-dev \
  libx11-dev:i386 libreadline6-dev:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 \
  libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib mingw32 tofrodos \
  python-markdown libxml2-utils xsltproc zlib1g-dev:i386
[/code]

then

[code]
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libGL.so
[/code]
